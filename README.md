# do-jquery-button
This is just a simple chrome extension skeleton that adds a browser button to just do some jQuery.

# How do I use this?
Clone this repo, change the jQuery in content.js, go to Settings -> Extensions -> Load unpacked extension; then select this cloned repo. Hey presto, you've got yourself a browser button that just DOES SOME JQUERY every time it's hit. 

# Why would I need this?
It's surprisingly useful when you've got a repetitive task that the designer of your office web app helpfully forgot to cater for.
